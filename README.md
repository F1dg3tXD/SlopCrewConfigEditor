## How to install:
Install [SlopCrew](https://github.com/SlopCrew/SlopCrew/blob/main/docs/Install%20Guide.md#gogmanual-installs) via manual installation first.
Ensure the SlopCrew config file is at
`\BepInEx\config\SlopCrew.Plugin.cfg`.
This is where the config editor expects to find it by default.
Launch the game with SlopCrew installed to make sure that it is working.
Place EditSlopCrewConfig.exe from the releases tab next to Bomb Rush Cyberfunk.exe in your game folder.
Launch it and set up SlopCrew as you want.
